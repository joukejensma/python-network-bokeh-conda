My aim was to experiment with several tools at once:

1. use bokeh for interactive plotting in the web client
2. use heroku for deploying Python applications into the cloud (given the miniconda distribution)
3. use Django for interactive web page development

The web page given shows a network (i.e. water) where flows must be balanced at each point.
It aims to minimize construction cost of the network (i.e. find that network/composition of pipelines for which the construction costs are minimized).
